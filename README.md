# eclectic-mapping-of-the-determinants-of-sleep-routine
This project is the bachelor thesis project of a group of students at the Open University of the Netherlands. The goal of the project is to map the determinants of sleeping at the same time every day in a comprehensive, and therefore theoretically eclectic, manner. In addition to providing evidence to inform health promotion efforts, the collected data can provide insight into the overlap of determinants from different theories used in behavior change interventions. The OSF repository for this project is https://osf.io/y5qht/.
